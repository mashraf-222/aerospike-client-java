	 * Maximum number of concurrent synchronous batch node request threads to server nodes.
	 * Asynchronous batch requests ignore this field and always issue all node requests in parallel.
	 * <p>
	 * The batch is split into requests for each node according to the node assignment of each
	 * batch key. The number of batch node requests is always less or equal to the cluster size.
	 * <p>
	 * If there are 16 batch node requests and maxConcurrentThreads is 8, then batch requests
	 * will be made for 8 nodes in parallel threads. When a request completes, a new request will
	 * be issued until all 16 requests are complete. If there are 4 batch node requests and
	 * maxConcurrentThreads is 8, then only 4 batch requests will be made for 4 nodes in parallel
	 * threads.
	 * <p>
	 * Values:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>
	 * 1 (default): Issue batch node requests sequentially. This mode has a performance advantage
	 * for small batch sizes because requests can be issued in the main transaction thread without
	 * using a thread pool. This mode is not optimal for batch requests spread out over many nodes
	 * in a large cluster.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * 0: Issue all batch node requests in parallel threads. This mode has a performance advantage
	 * for large batch sizes because each node can process the request immediately. The downside is
	 * extra threads will need to be created (or taken from a thread pool). In extreme cases, the
	 * operating system's thread capacity could be exhausted.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * > 0: Issue up to maxConcurrentThreads batch node requests in parallel threads. When a request
	 * completes, a new request will be issued until all requests are complete. This mode prevents
	 * too many parallel threads being created for large clusters. The downside is extra threads
	 * will still need to be created (or taken from a thread pool). A typical value is the number
	 * of cpu cores available on the client machine.
