 * <pre>{@code
 * AerospikeClient client = new AerospikeClient(new ClientPolicy(), "localhost", 3000);
 * Txn txn = new Txn();
 * // ... attach txn to multi-record ops, then decide to abort
 * AbortStatus status = client.abort(txn);

 *     // Abort completed or was already aborted
 * } else {
 *     // ROLL_BACK_ABANDONED or CLOSE_ABANDONED; server will eventually abort
 *     System.err.println(status.str);
